  <h2>HTML</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/single-page.html" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> is the standard markup language for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications.
  First developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990, HTML is short for HyperText Markup Language.HTML is used to create electronic documents (called pages)
    that are displayed on the World Wide Web. Each page contains a series of connections to other pages called hyperlinks. Every web page you see on the Internet
    is written using one version of HTML code or another.
  HTML code ensures the proper formatting of text and images so that your Internet browser may display them as they are intended to look.</p>

  <p style="margin-top:40px;">Without HTML, a browser would not know how to display text as elements or load images or other elements. HTML also provides a basic structure of the page,
  upon which Cascading Style Sheets are overlaid to change its appearance. One could think of HTML as the bones (structure) of a web page,
  and CSS as its skin (appearance).</p>
